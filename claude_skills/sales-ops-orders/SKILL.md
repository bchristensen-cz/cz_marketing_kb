# Querying Cafe Zupas Order Data

> **Freshness check:** this file must come from a clone of `https://github.com/bchristensen-cz/cz_marketing_kb` `main` pulled **this session**. If you're reading it from an installed skill package, a fork, or any saved copy, stop and re-clone first — it may be stale.

> **⚠️ Breaking changes 2026-07-24** — `order_customer` was rebuilt across all history. `businessdate` is now **`business_date`**; `net_sales` is now the **calculated** net (read it directly); `item_net_sales` / `item_netsales_with_mods` / `mods_net_sales` are **gone**; `is_catering` was redefined; a **`customer_type`** column was added and is now **required for customer metrics**; `order_count` / `days_since_prev_order` moved to the new **`sales_ops.order_sequence`** table. Any saved query written before this date needs updating.

> **✅ Deployment status 2026-07-27 — `customer_type` is LIVE.** Verified against `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`; the earlier "not deployed yet" warning is resolved and the interim email-based stand-in filter is retired. Use `customer_type` directly. Also live in the same rebuild: `mapped_email_domain`, and `is_guest_order` **changed from INTEGER 0/1 to BOOLEAN** — `is_guest_order = 1` now fails, use `= true`.
>
> One fix is written but **not yet redeployed**: the `pulse.orders` fan-out dedupe (Asana 1216918745136203). Until the next full rebuild, `brink_order_id` 2279778269187 still has two rows.

Project: `marketing-data-442316`. The three approved tables for order/sales analysis:

- **`sales_ops.order_customer`** — one row per order. Sales, channel, customer identity. Default table for sales/order/customer questions.
- **`sales_ops.order_lines`** — one row per line element. Menu mix, items, modifiers, combos.
- **`sales_ops.order_sequence`** — one row per identified-person order. Order sequencing, recency, lifetime counts.

Full column docs in `data_dictionaries/`: `sales_ops.order_customer.md`, `sales_ops.order_lines.md`, `sales_ops.order_sequence.md`. Read them before writing non-trivial queries.

## Hard rules (consistency guarantees)

1. **Never query upstream/raw datasets** (`brink.*`, `pulse.*`, `sessionM.*`) to answer business questions. They contain voided rows, duplicates, and unfiltered records that these marts already handle. If the marts can't answer the question, say so — don't improvise from raw tables.
2. **Always filter the partition column** on every table. `order_customer` and `order_sequence` use `business_date`; `order_lines` still uses `BusinessDate`. Never run unbounded scans.
3. **Same metric, same definition.** Use the canonical definitions below verbatim.
4. Data is fresh as of the top of the current hour (loads run at minute :02, intraday 8am–11pm MT reload today's date only; hours 0–3 and 5–7 skip). Yesterday and older is stable after the 4am run.
5. **Brink is the sole financial source of truth** (steward rule 2026-07-23). Pulse is a helper for digital order/customer metadata only — never compute financials (sales, discounts, tax, tips) from Pulse data.
6. **Customer metrics require `customer_type = 'person'`** (steward rule 2026-07-24). See below — this is not optional.
7. **All datasets are read-only.** If you need to materialize a table (intermediate results, cohorts), create it ONLY in `marketing-data-442316.scratch` — the single writable dataset; tables there auto-expire after 7 days. Materialize with `create table scratch.x as ...`, not views: a view over a heavy query silently re-runs the full scan on every select.

## Canonical metric definitions

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| Net sales | `sum(net_sales)` from `order_customer`. The column **is** the canonical calculated net (`gross_sales - total_discount_amount - total_promotions_amount`) as of 2026-07-24. Do NOT use `brink_net_sales` — validation only |
| Gross sales | `sum(gross_sales)` from `order_customer` |
| Order count | `count(*)` from `order_customer` (or `count(distinct brink_order_id)` — see the grain defect note) |
| Average check | `sum(net_sales) / count(*)` from `order_customer` |
| Identified customers | `count(distinct mapped_cust_id)` where `mapped_cust_id is not null` **and `customer_type = 'person'`** |
| Guest orders | `is_guest_order = true` (BOOLEAN since 2026-07-27, was 0/1) |
| Catering | `is_catering = true` for the business line; `revenue_category = 'Catering'` for channel reporting (see gotchas — they differ slightly) |
| Channel | `revenue_category` (In-Store, Digital, Third_Party, Catering, Fundraiser) |
| Digital source | `order_source` (NULL = in-store POS) |
| First-time order | `order_sequence.customer_order_count = 1` — but only back to 2023-03-06 (see gotchas) |
| Repeat order | `order_sequence.customer_order_count > 1` |
| Lifetime orders per customer | `order_sequence.lifetime_customer_order_count` |
| Items sold | `order_lines` where `line_item_type = 'item'`, measure `sum(qty)` or `count(*)` |
| Item sales | `sum(item_gross_sales)` from `order_lines`. Discounts/promotions are order-level lines with no per-item allocation, so per-item **net is not computable** from the mart — use gross for item mix |
| Menu mix name | `item_name` (size-normalized) + `item_size`; category via `item_type` or `rev_center_name` |

### The `customer_type` rule (steward rule 2026-07-24)

`order_customer.customer_type` classifies the customer **on each order** as `person`, `kiosk`, `internal`, or `aggregator` (NULL when unidentified). **38% of identified orders belong to non-person ids** — shared outdoor-kiosk terminal accounts, employee/developer accounts, and the third-party ordering funnel (ezcater / doordash / itsacheckmate), dominated by pulse id `19192` at ~108K orders a month across 89 stores.

- **Customer-level metrics** (customer counts, frequency, retention, cohorts, LTV, first-time vs repeat) → filter `customer_type = 'person'`. Without it the numbers are materially wrong, not slightly off.
- **Sales / order / channel metrics** → do **not** filter. Those are real orders and real revenue; excluding them understates sales by ~$4.2M/month.

State which you did whenever it affects the answer.

**It's order-level, not customer-level** (steward decision 2026-07-27). The same `mapped_cust_id` can carry different types across its orders — June 2026: 30 ids / 108,313 orders, with `19192` splitting 107,807 `aggregator` + 196 `person`. This is deliberate: `19192` doesn't exist in `pulse.customers` (dev ticket open), so there's no reliable customer-level attribute to collapse onto. Practical effect: `count(distinct mapped_cust_id) where customer_type = 'person'` slightly overcounts. Filtering *orders* by `customer_type = 'person'` is still the correct rule. `order_sequence` applies its own customer-level guard, so sequencing and lifetime counts are unaffected.

**Required clarifications (steward rule 2026-07-23):** if the user hasn't already stated them, ASK before querying — do not assume defaults:

1. **Date range** — which dates the question covers.
2. **Catering** — included or excluded.

Not up for discussion: **store 1111 is ALWAYS excluded** (test/training store — add `store_id <> 1111` on whichever table you're querying; never include it, don't ask). Remaining defaults unless the user says otherwise: include employee-discount orders, all channels. State all assumptions in the answer when they matter.

## SQL style (steward rule 2026-07-23 — MANDATORY)

All SQL — shown to users or executed — follows the steward's format so he can diagnose any query quickly. Match the build scripts in `sql/`:

1. **Fully qualify every table**: `` `marketing-data-442316`.dataset.table `` — never rely on a default project or dataset.
2. **Lowercase whenever possible**: keywords, functions, aliases. Column names as they exist in the schema (e.g. `business_date` on `order_customer`, `BusinessDate` on `order_lines`).
3. **Layout**:
   - select list: one column per line, **leading commas**, first column on the line after `select`; column aliases use `as`
   - CTEs: `with name as (` … `)`, chained as `, next_name as (`
   - `where 1=1`, then each condition on its own `and ...` line
   - each join on its own line, `on ...` on the next line, indented; short lowercase table aliases (`oc`, `ol`, `os`)

## Join patterns

**order_customer → order_lines** (note the two different partition column spellings):
```sql
select
...
from `marketing-data-442316`.sales_ops.order_lines ol
	join `marketing-data-442316`.sales_ops.order_customer oc
	on oc.brink_order_id = ol.brink_order_id
where 1=1
and ol.BusinessDate between @start and @end
and oc.business_date between @start and @end   -- partition-prune BOTH tables
```

**order_customer → order_sequence** (always `left join` — a missing row means unidentified, not an error):
```sql
select
...
from `marketing-data-442316`.sales_ops.order_customer oc
	left join `marketing-data-442316`.sales_ops.order_sequence os
	on os.brink_order_id = oc.brink_order_id
	and os.business_date = oc.business_date
where 1=1
and oc.business_date between @start and @end
and os.business_date between @start and @end
```

## Recipes

**Daily net sales by channel (last 30 days):**
```sql
select
oc.business_date
, oc.revenue_category
, round(sum(oc.net_sales), 2) as net_sales
, count(*) as orders
from `marketing-data-442316`.sales_ops.order_customer oc
where 1=1
and oc.business_date >= date_sub(current_date('America/Denver'), interval 30 day)
and oc.store_id <> 1111
group by 1, 2
order by 1, 2
```

**Identified customer counts (person only):**
```sql
select
date_trunc(oc.business_date, month) as month
, count(distinct oc.mapped_cust_id) as customers
, count(*) as orders
, round(sum(oc.net_sales), 2) as net_sales
from `marketing-data-442316`.sales_ops.order_customer oc
where 1=1
and oc.business_date >= date_sub(current_date('America/Denver'), interval 365 day)
and oc.store_id <> 1111
and oc.mapped_cust_id is not null
and oc.customer_type = 'person'
group by 1
order by 1
```

**First-time vs repeat orders (last 30 days):**
```sql
select
oc.business_date
, case
    when os.brink_order_id is null then 'Unidentified'
    when os.customer_order_count = 1 then 'First-time'
    else 'Repeat'
  end as guest_type
, count(*) as orders
, round(sum(oc.net_sales), 2) as net_sales
from `marketing-data-442316`.sales_ops.order_customer oc
	left join `marketing-data-442316`.sales_ops.order_sequence os
	on os.brink_order_id = oc.brink_order_id
	and os.business_date = oc.business_date
where 1=1
and oc.business_date >= date_sub(current_date('America/Denver'), interval 30 day)
and os.business_date >= date_sub(current_date('America/Denver'), interval 30 day)
and oc.store_id <> 1111
group by 1, 2
order by 1, 2
```

**Top items by quantity (entrées, last 90 days):**
```sql
select
ol.item_name
, ol.item_size
, sum(ol.qty) as qty
, round(sum(ol.item_gross_sales), 0) as gross_sales
from `marketing-data-442316`.sales_ops.order_lines ol
where 1=1
and ol.BusinessDate >= date_sub(current_date('America/Denver'), interval 90 day)
and ol.store_id <> 1111
and ol.line_item_type = 'item'
and ol.item_type = 'Entree'
group by 1, 2
order by 3 desc
limit 25
```

**Try 2 Combo count and composition:**
```sql
select
ol.parent_item_grp_name
, count(distinct ol.combo_order_line_item_id) as combos
from `marketing-data-442316`.sales_ops.order_lines ol
where 1=1
and ol.BusinessDate >= date_sub(current_date('America/Denver'), interval 30 day)
and ol.store_id <> 1111
and ol.parent_rev_center_name = 'Try 2 Combo'
group by 1
order by 2 desc
```

## Guest checkout (launched 2026-06-25) — known gap

Guest checkout (web/mobile-web ordering without signing in) went live around **2026-06-25**, with the first orders landing **2026-06-29**. A guest-checkout order looks like this on `order_customer`:

```sql
and oc.order_source in ('mobile_web_source', 'web_source')   -- `source` on the legacy table
and oc.email is null
and oc.mapped_email is null
```

**The mart carries no email or identity for these orders**, so you cannot tell a brand-new guest from a lapsed known customer using the approved tables alone. The two known workarounds both leave the walls and are therefore **not approved for business answers**:

1. `pulse.order_customers.email` joined on `cast(oc.pulse_order_id as string) = cast(po.order_id as string)` (note the cast — the types differ).
2. Braze `customevent` where `name = 'guest_email_from_order'`, `$.order_id` in `properties`; also `users.custom_attributes.guest_test_email`.

If a question needs guest-checkout identity, say the mart can't answer it and point at Asana 1216806056925588 (cohort mart with guest-checkout linkage). Three separate analysts hand-rolled workaround #1 on 2026-07-24.

## Gotchas checklist (scan before answering)

- **Partition columns differ by table**: `order_customer.business_date` and `order_sequence.business_date` vs `order_lines.BusinessDate`. A rename of `order_lines` is planned; until then, spell both correctly or the query fails or scans everything.
- **Customer metrics need `customer_type = 'person'`**; sales metrics must NOT filter it. See the rule above.
- **Net sales is the `net_sales` column** — read it directly (calculated at build since 2026-07-24). `brink_net_sales` is Brink-given and validation-only; it runs ~0.0025% above calculated net ($479 on $18.9M in June 2026). There is no per-item or per-modifier net in the mart any more.
- **`is_catering` is a superset of `revenue_category = 'Catering'`** — every catering-destination order is TRUE, plus a handful (48 in June 2026) that pulse flagged as catering on In-Store/Digital destinations. Before 2026-07-24 the flag missed all POS-only catering (641 orders / $70.7K net in June), so pre-rebuild catering numbers understate it.
- **Grain defect (1 order in ~50M):** `brink_order_id` 2279778269187 has two rows in `order_customer` — two pulse orders point at one Brink order, double-counting $263.99 across two customers. Immaterial to totals; use `count(distinct brink_order_id)` if exact uniqueness matters.
- **`order_sequence` history starts 2023-03-06**, not 2018. `customer_order_count = 1` means "first order since March 2023", not first-ever. Say so when presenting first-time-guest numbers.
- **`order_sequence` is a `left join`, never inner** — ~2/3 of orders have no row (unidentified or non-person) and an inner join silently drops them.
- **`order_sequence` also excludes 965 customer ids entirely** via its customer-level guard (any id ever seen as non-person). Mostly staff who occasionally ordered with a work email. For employee ordering behaviour, work from `order_customer` directly.
- `order_lines.amount` sums to order gross ONLY when filtered to `line_item_type in ('item','fee','surcharge','modifier')` — tip and gift_card lines carry non-sales amounts, discounts/promotions are negative. For item mix, `item_gross_sales` on `line_item_type = 'item'` is still the measure.
- Item counts need `line_item_type = 'item'`, else modifiers ~double the count.
- `qty` is derived from price and approximate; fine for mix, not for inventory-grade counts.
- Line-level sums won't exactly reconcile to `order_customer` order-level sales (order-level discounts, rounding). Order-level `net_sales` from `order_customer` is the truth for sales. Quantified 2026-07-23 (post modifier-gross fix): ~1.3% of orders have no `order_lines` rows (all $0-net fully-voided orders — benign); on the rest, line reconstruction matches 99.99% of orders (aggregate within ~$1.5K on $55M/90d). Still: report sales totals from `order_customer`, not `order_lines`.
- `rev_center_name = 'Foutain Beverages'` is misspelled in source — match it as-is.
- `is_guest_order` is loyalty-based (91% of all-time orders are guest); `mapped_cust_id` coverage is ~53% over the last year, and only ~62% of *that* is a real person.
- **Store 1111 is a test/training store — ALWAYS exclude it** (`store_id <> 1111`) in all sales, order, and item metrics on all tables. No exceptions (steward rule 2026-07-23). Note `order_sequence` sequence numbers are built without that exclusion.
- Store footprint: ~90 stores in UT, AZ, MN, NV, WI, ID, IL, OH, TX. Store attributes come from `sales_ops.store_info`.
- **Business week is Monday–Saturday** — all stores are closed Sunday. "Last week" means the most recent Mon–Sat; weekly averages divide by 6 days, not 7. Don't use Sun-anchored `date_trunc(..., week)` for CZ weeks (observed in analyst SQL 2026-07-22; steward-confirmed pending). Use `date_trunc(d, week(monday))` to bucket weeks.
- **Year-over-year offset is 364 days, not 1 year** — `date_sub(d, interval 364 day)` (52 × 7) keeps the day-of-week aligned, which matters because the week is Mon–Sat and Sundays are zero. `date_sub(d, interval 1 year)` shifts the weekday and drags a Sunday into the comparison window. Convention observed in analyst SQL 2026-07-24.
- Timezone: business runs on `America/Denver` for schedule logic; each store's local time is in `order_datetime`, UTC in `order_customer.order_timestamp_utc`.
- There is **no `order_id` column** on any of these tables — the order key is `brink_order_id` (multiple users have hit this error).
- A legacy table `sales_ops.OrderCustomer` also exists (different schema: `netsales`, `iscatering`, `storeid`, `lifetime_order_cnt`, `first_order_datetime`, `order_count`, `mapped_domain`, `source`, …). **Do not use it** — it predates this mart and gives different answers. `sales_ops.order_customer` (lowercase) is the only canonical order table.
  - **It is now also going stale**: on 2026-07-27 its `max(BusinessDate)` was **2026-07-25** while `order_customer` had loaded through 2026-07-27. Answers from it are silently 1–2 days short of current. Three separate users queried it during 2026-07-24 → 2026-07-26.
  - `iscatering` on the legacy table is **INT64** (`iscatering = 0`); `is_catering` on the canonical mart is **BOOL** (`is_catering = false`). Writing `is_catering = 0` fails with `No matching signature for operator = for argument types: BOOL, INT64` (observed 2026-07-24) — a reliable sign a query was written against the legacy schema.
- **`sales_ops.store_info` column names are not the obvious ones** — it's `store_state`, not `state`; `store_city`, `store_zip`, `store_address`, `store_short_name`. Full column list: `store_id`, `store_name`, `store_address`, `store_city`, `store_state`, `store_zip`, `store_phone`, `store_short_name`, `store_tz`, `store_open_date`, `is_comp_store`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `weather_cluster_id`, `timezone_name`. Join `store_info.store_id = order_customer.store_id`. (Guessing `state` failed an analyst session 2026-07-24; a full dictionary is still pending — Asana 1216807058217060.)
- `sales_ops.order_discount` exists (order-level discount lines: `order_id`, `discount_id`, `name`, `amount`, `loyalty_reward_id`, …) but is **not yet documented** — join keys unverified. If a question needs it, treat answers as provisional until its dictionary lands.
- **Employee/test exclusion:** internal accounts are identifiable via `customer_type = 'internal'` (`@cafezupas.com`, `@tkxel.com`, `@tkxel.io`) — 119 ids / 736 orders in June 2026. The new `mapped_email_domain` column closes the old `mapped_domain` mart gap on this table. Unidentified internal orders still can't be flagged.
- The old `cowork_interim` and `nces_staging` scratch datasets were dropped 2026-07-22. Any saved query referencing them must be rebuilt against the marts (materialize intermediates in `scratch` if needed).

## When done

If you learned something new about these tables during the session (new gotcha, new canonical definition, data quality issue), do **not** edit this skill or any local copy — only the data steward commits to the repo, and session copies are discarded. Instead, create an Asana task on the **Claude Data** board (workspace cafezupas.com, project `1216769551099591`) titled `KB finding: <short title>`, describing what you observed (include the query that surfaced it) and the proposed change. The steward reviews and merges vetted findings; the next session's fresh clone benefits automatically.
