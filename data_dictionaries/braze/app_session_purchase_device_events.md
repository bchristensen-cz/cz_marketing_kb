## App / Session, Purchase & Device Events

### `app_firstsession`

_Active - 10,720,570 rows, 3.27 GB, 21 columns, table._ Records the first app session ever logged for a user, including the originating device, locale, and SDK details.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | STRING | Unique event identifier (UUID) and the DEDUPE KEY: the currents_merge job can emit duplicate rows, so event-level counts must be count(distinct id), never count(*). |
| `user_id` | STRING | Braze internal user identifier (braze_id) for the user. |
| `external_user_id` | STRING | Externally provided user ID (external_id) - the Cafe Zupas customer ID used to join to source systems. |
| `app_id` | STRING | Identifier of the specific app/platform build the event is tied to. |
| `time` | INT64 | Unix epoch seconds - the ONLY true-UTC clock on the event tables. For a UTC instant use timestamp_seconds(time). This is the Braze side of any comparison to order_timestamp_utc. |
| `session_id` | STRING | Identifier of the session. |
| `gender` | STRING | User gender at first session. |
| `country` | STRING | Country of the user. |
| `timezone` | STRING | User's IANA time zone (e.g., America/Denver) at time of event. |
| `language` | STRING | User language. |
| `device_id` | STRING | Braze device identifier. |
| `sdk_version` | STRING | Braze SDK version on the device. |
| `platform` | STRING | Device platform (e.g., iOS, Android, Web). |
| `os_version` | STRING | Operating system version of the device. |
| `device_model` | STRING | Device model. |
| `app_group_id` | STRING | Identifier of the Braze app group (workspace) the event belongs to. |
| `event_timestamp` | DATETIME | Event time as a DATETIME in America/Denver WALL-CLOCK time (follows US Mountain DST). NOT UTC. extract(hour ...) is already Mountain. Never cast(event_timestamp as timestamp) or datetime(cast(..),'America/Denver') - both assert UTC on a local value and land 6-7 h early. |
| `event_date` | DATE | America/Denver LOCAL calendar date of the event (= date(event_timestamp)); the partition column - always filter it. Not the UTC date. A __NULL__ partition exists (event_date is null rows) and is silently dropped by a between filter. |
| `local_event_datetime` | DATETIME | Event datetime in the USER's own time zone (per the timezone column); differs from event_timestamp for out-of-Mountain users. Use for user-local daypart only. |
| `create_datetime` | DATETIME | current_datetime() at insert (UTC civil time) - when the row LANDED in the warehouse, not when the event happened. Useful for isolating rows from one load. |
| `workspace` | STRING | Braze workspace: 'cafe_zupas' (main, ~99% of volume) or 'cafe_zupas_catering'. CANONICAL DEFAULT: filter workspace = 'cafe_zupas'; include catering only when asked and keep workspace in the grain (campaign ids never cross workspaces). |
