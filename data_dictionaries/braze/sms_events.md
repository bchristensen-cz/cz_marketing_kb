## SMS Events

### `sms_send`

_Active - 3,613,599 rows, 1.66 GB, 33 columns, table._ SMS sent to the SMS provider. NOTE: since the 2026-07 streaming switch RCS carries most text volume (~4x SMS) - any text-campaign question must include rcs_* too.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | STRING | Unique event identifier (UUID) and the DEDUPE KEY: the currents_merge job can emit duplicate rows, so event-level counts must be count(distinct id), never count(*). |
| `user_id` | STRING | Braze internal user identifier (braze_id) for the user. |
| `dispatch_id` | STRING | ID of the message dispatch (one send batch to a user). |
| `external_user_id` | STRING | Externally provided user ID (external_id) - the Cafe Zupas customer ID used to join to source systems. |
| `time` | INT64 | Unix epoch seconds - the ONLY true-UTC clock on the event tables. For a UTC instant use timestamp_seconds(time). This is the Braze side of any comparison to order_timestamp_utc. |
| `timezone` | STRING | User's IANA time zone (e.g., America/Denver) at time of event. |
| `campaign_id` | STRING | Braze campaign ID that sent/triggered the message. |
| `campaign_name` | STRING | Name of the Braze campaign. |
| `message_variation_id` | STRING | ID of the message variation (A/B test variant) sent. |
| `message_variation_name` | STRING | Name of the message variation sent. |

| `canvas_variation_name` | STRING | Name of the Canvas variation. |
| `canvas_step_id` | STRING | ID of the Canvas step that produced the event. |
| `canvas_step_name` | STRING | Name of the Canvas step. |
| `send_id` | STRING | Identifier grouping all messages from a single send, used for send-level analytics. |
| `category` | STRING | Message category/classification. |
| `message_extras` | STRING | Custom key-value metadata attached to the message (JSON string). |
| `app_group_id` | STRING | Identifier of the Braze app group (workspace) the event belongs to. |

| `event_timestamp` | DATETIME | Event time as a DATETIME in America/Denver WALL-CLOCK time (follows US Mountain DST). NOT UTC. extract(hour ...) is already Mountain. Never cast(event_timestamp as timestamp) or datetime(cast(..),'America/Denver') - both assert UTC on a local value and land 6-7 h early. |
| `event_date` | DATE | America/Denver LOCAL calendar date of the event (= date(event_timestamp)); the partition column - always filter it. Not the UTC date. A __NULL__ partition exists (event_date is null rows) and is silently dropped by a between filter. |
| `local_event_datetime` | DATETIME | Event datetime in the USER's own time zone (per the timezone column); differs from event_timestamp for out-of-Mountain users. Use for user-local daypart only. |
| `create_datetime` | DATETIME | current_datetime() at insert (UTC civil time) - when the row LANDED in the warehouse, not when the event happened. Useful for isolating rows from one load. |
| `device_id` | STRING | Braze device identifier. |

| `is_canvas` | INT64 | Flag (1/0) indicating whether the message originated from a Canvas (1) vs a Campaign (0). Not present on streaming-era tables; derive as case when coalesce(canvas_id,'') <> '' then 1 else 0 end. |
| `event_timestamp` | DATETIME | Event time as a DATETIME in America/Denver WALL-CLOCK time (follows US Mountain DST). NOT UTC. extract(hour ...) is already Mountain. Never cast(event_timestamp as timestamp) or datetime(cast(..),'America/Denver') - both assert UTC on a local value and land 6-7 h early. |

| `workspace` | STRING | Braze workspace: 'cafe_zupas' (main, ~99% of volume) or 'cafe_zupas_catering'. CANONICAL DEFAULT: filter workspace = 'cafe_zupas'; include catering only when asked and keep workspace in the grain (campaign ids never cross workspaces). |

### `sms_shortlinkclick`

_Active - 217,395 rows, 0.13 GB, 33 columns, table._ Click on a Braze SMS short link, including resolved URL and bot-click detection.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | STRING | Unique event identifier (UUID) and the DEDUPE KEY: the currents_merge job can emit duplicate rows, so event-level counts must be count(distinct id), never count(*). |
| `user_id` | STRING | Braze internal user identifier (braze_id) for the user. |
| `external_user_id` | STRING | Externally provided user ID (external_id) - the Cafe Zupas customer ID used to join to source systems. |
| `app_group_id` | STRING | Identifier of the Braze app group (workspace) the event belongs to. |
| `time` | INT64 | Unix epoch seconds - the ONLY true-UTC clock on the event tables. For a UTC instant use timestamp_seconds(time). This is the Braze side of any comparison to order_timestamp_utc. |
| `timezone` | STRING | User's IANA time zone (e.g., America/Denver) at time of event. |
| `campaign_id` | STRING | Braze campaign ID that sent/triggered the message. |
| `campaign_name` | STRING | Name of the Braze campaign. |
| `message_variation_id` | STRING | ID of the message variation (A/B test variant) sent. |
| `message_variation_name` | STRING | Name of the message variation sent. |
| `canvas_id` | STRING | Braze Canvas (journey) ID associated with the message. |
| `canvas_name` | STRING | Name of the Braze Canvas. |
| `canvas_variation_id` | STRING | ID of the Canvas variation the user is in. |
| `canvas_variation_name` | STRING | Name of the Canvas variation. |
| `canvas_step_id` | STRING | ID of the Canvas step that produced the event. |
| `canvas_step_name` | STRING | Name of the Canvas step. |
| `url` | STRING | Resolved destination URL. |
| `short_url` | STRING | The Braze short link that was clicked. |
| `user_agent` | STRING | User-agent string captured for the event. |
| `user_phone_number` | STRING | The user's phone number. |
| `cmpgn_id` | STRING | Legacy/duplicate campaign ID field included in the export. |
| `cmpgn_name` | STRING | Legacy/duplicate campaign name field included in the export. |
| `cmpgn_variation_id` | STRING | Legacy/duplicate message variation ID field. |
| `cmpgn_variation_name` | STRING | Legacy/duplicate message variation name field. |
| `is_canvas` | INT64 | Flag (1/0) indicating whether the message originated from a Canvas (1) vs a Campaign (0). Not present on streaming-era tables; derive as case when coalesce(canvas_id,'') <> '' then 1 else 0 end. |
| `event_timestamp` | DATETIME | Event time as a DATETIME in America/Denver WALL-CLOCK time (follows US Mountain DST). NOT UTC. extract(hour ...) is already Mountain. Never cast(event_timestamp as timestamp) or datetime(cast(..),'America/Denver') - both assert UTC on a local value and land 6-7 h early. |
| `event_date` | DATE | America/Denver LOCAL calendar date of the event (= date(event_timestamp)); the partition column - always filter it. Not the UTC date. A __NULL__ partition exists (event_date is null rows) and is silently dropped by a between filter. |
| `local_event_datetime` | DATETIME | Event datetime in the USER's own time zone (per the timezone column); differs from event_timestamp for out-of-Mountain users. Use for user-local daypart only. |
| `create_datetime` | DATETIME | current_datetime() at insert (UTC civil time) - when the row LANDED in the warehouse, not when the event happened. Useful for isolating rows from one load. |
| `device_id` | STRING | Braze device identifier. |
| `is_suspected_bot_click` | BOOL | TRUE if Braze flagged the click as a suspected bot / security-scanner click rather than a human click. Exclude for human engagement. |
| `suspected_bot_click_reason` | ARRAY<STRING> | Reason(s) the click was flagged as a suspected bot click. |
| `workspace` | STRING | Braze workspace: 'cafe_zupas' (main, ~99% of volume) or 'cafe_zupas_catering'. CANONICAL DEFAULT: filter workspace = 'cafe_zupas'; include catering only when asked and keep workspace in the grain (campaign ids never cross workspaces). |
